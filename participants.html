	<h3>Study 2</h3>
	<!-- <p class="subheader">April – September 2017</p> -->
	<div class="participantsBar">
		<div class="boxBox boxBoxLeft">
			<h4>For Dads</h4>
			<p>You would be eligible to take part in this study if you are expecting to become a father for the first time and:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>there is at least 3 months until your baby’s expected date of birth (so your partner is not over 6 months pregnant)</p> </li>
				<li><p>you live in one of the five London boroughs – Lambeth, Southwark, Ealing, Brent or Harrow.</p> </li>
			</ul>

			<p>Every family in England with a child under the age of 5 years receives regular contacts with a local health visitor. We are looking to better understand how the health visitors use a particular resource known as the ‘Promotional Guide System’ to support men as they become fathers for the first time.</p> 

			<p>If you agree to take part in this study, you will be invited to complete three questionnaires (one before the birth of your baby and two after your child’s birth).  The questionnaires can be completed either online, or if you prefer, you can be sent a paper copy to complete and return to the researchers using a pre-paid envelope. If you would prefer a paper copy then please click here to send a message to the researcher. You will be asked to complete the first questionnaire around 8-12 weeks before your baby is born.</p> 

			<p>The second questionnaire will need to be completed around 3 months after your baby’s birth and the third questionnaire when your baby is around 6 months old. We will send you reminders to complete the second and third questionnaires by email or text messages, and can send paper copies of the questionnaires with pre-paid envelopes if this is what you would prefer.</p>

			<p>You may be invited to take part in an interview with a member of the research team, or an observation of your one of your visits with a health visitor. If you take part in the interview, you will be asked about your views and experiences of health services received. The interview can be carried out over telephone or face-to-face and will be audio-recorded. It is likely to last between 45 -60 minutes, and will be arranged at a time to suit you.</p> 

			<p>If you take part in the observation it will take place during one of your contacts with the health visitor. During the observation you will not be required to do anything. It is the health visitor who will be observed and detailed notes will be taken on the information given by the health visitor.</p> 

			<p>Your name or personal details will not be recorded during this interview or observation, and therefore you will remain anonymous. All information collected will be kept confidential and any identifiable information will be removed from any publications or presentations about the study. Joining the study is completely up to you, but before you decide we would like you to understand why the research is being done and what it would involve for you. Please download and read the Participant Information Sheet for full details.</p>
